Image filtering is method of applying filter to an image in order to bring a desired characteristic i.e. blur, motion blur, edge detection, emboss and sharpen. The required effect is obtained by convolution of the image with the required filter to produce a new image. Here the operation performed on each pixel is independent of one another, thus this can be exploited by operating each pixel parallel with the help of Graphics Processing Unit GPU. In this the various filter method are first implemented in CPU. Later these are implemented in the GPU by using three different types of memories i.e. Global memory, Constant memory and Texture memory. The speedups obtained by different GPU implementation over the CPU are compared.

In this type of image filtering the filter using is a 2D filter. The filter is applied to the image by convolution i.e. sum of the products is taken for every pixel of the image. The center of the filter matrix is multiplied with the current pixel of the image, the other elements of the filter matrix with the corresponding neighbor pixels. This operation is known as convolution.The filterused here needs to be uneven i.e. it should be 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 etc. so that it has a center.

-Blur is the technique of reducing detail in image by defocusing the pixels which causes the image to be unclear.
-Motion blur is the apparent streaking of rapidly moving objects in a still image or a sequence of images. It results when the image that is being recorded changes either during the recording of a single exposure or due to rapid movement or long exposure. This effect can be obtained on the image using the emboss filter.
-Image embossing is a technique of replacing each pixels of an image with a shadow depending on the light and dark boundaries of the original image. When a embossing filter is applied to the image the resultant image resembles a paper or metal embossing of the original image.
-In image sharpening the edges are made brighter which improves image quality. However, if done aggressively, it can make the image look artificial.
-Edge detection is a process of finding the boundaries of the object within an image. The edges can easily found by finding the discontinuities in brightness.

The image filtering technique is applied in both CPU and GPU. The filter calculation here involves two double for loop. The first for loop for iterating through each pixel of the image and the second for loop for iterating through each element of a filter. The border pixels are handled by wrapping around the image.
In case of the CPU implementation separate function are written for each filter type as the size of the filter and values in filter varies for each effect. In this case since each pixel of the image is accesses sequentially by the CPU, the processing time taken for applying the various filter to the images is generally high. The image convolution operation generally takes the maximum time in case of image filtering.
Since the image filtering algorithm is highly parallel, therefore the individual pixel operation can be parallelized in the GPU. In the GPU the first double for loop is removes as each individual pixel is handled by a separate thread. In GPU three implementation are taken into account.
The first implementation uses global memory for both the filter and image. The second implementation involves texture memory in which the image is stored and texture memory is optimized for 2D access pattern. The third implementation the constant memory is used for storing filter values, since the size of constant memory is small, it cannot be used for storing images.
Blur, Motion blur, Ege detection, Emboss and Sharpen are the different filtering techniques applied in both CPU and GPU.
Here the different implementations of GPU were written as separate kernels and called appropriately.
